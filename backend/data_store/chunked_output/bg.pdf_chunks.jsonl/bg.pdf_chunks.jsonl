{"content": "Background of the Study\nThe rapid growth of digital learning technologies has transformed how students access and\nengage with information. In higher education, online platforms, e-books, and lecture\nrecordings have become indispensable resources for both faculty and students,\nparticularly following the COVID-19 pandemic (Lucero et al., 2022). Despite this shift, a\nrecurring challenge remains: while students can access vast amounts of information, they", "metadata": {"id": "01eef4332074fe86e21557d1a8a5b61f428b1bb4", "source": "bg.pdf", "page": 1, "author": "Unknown", "created_at": "2025-08-29T14:41:50Z"}}
