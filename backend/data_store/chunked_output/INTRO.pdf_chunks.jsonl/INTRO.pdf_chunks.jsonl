{"content": "I. General Field Introduction (Education & Technology)\nIn Philippine higher education, digital learning materials—such as e-books, online modules, and\nelectronic resources—are becoming increasingly integral to academic instruction and study. A\n2022 study assessing e-learning readiness across government and private HEIs found that both\nfaculty and students are adapting to digital instruction, though they still face challenges related to\ntraining, infrastructure, and awareness of tools (Lucero et al., 2022). Complementing this, an\nempirical investigation into university students’ usage of electronic resources revealed that half\nof respondents “always” use these materials for research tasks, indicating their importance in\nacademic engagement (Rosales, 2021). Together, these findings highlight a significant trend\ntoward digital adoption in Philippine higher education, albeit with practical limitations that still\nneed to be addressed.", "metadata": {"id": "9980ae3f13c9fa61d7eb41cbf59e6c773878ebb0", "source": "INTRO.pdf", "page": 1, "author": "Unknown", "created_at": "2025-08-29T15:17:25Z"}}

Traditional academic chatbots tend to rely either on static, pre-defined\nresponses or purely generative systems, limiting their contextual accuracy and adaptability\nto specific course content.

Proposed Solution Preview\nThis study proposes the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a hybrid\napproach that combines the retrieval of relevant context from a predefined knowledge\nbase with generative AI models to produce accurate, context-aware responses. Unlike\ntraditional generative models that rely solely on learned patterns, RAG mitigates\nhallucination by grounding responses in verified content, such as lecture notes and\ncourse materials (Lewis et al., 2020). This makes it particularly suitable for academic\nenvironments where factual accuracy and relevance are critical.
